\author{Joe Loughry\thanks{This is the chapter titled `Optical TEMPEST' in
Ireneusz Kubiak's new book.}}
\chapter{Optical TEMPEST}
\section{History}
\subsection{Information Leakage}
\subsubsection{Electromagnetic}
Field telephones in WWI; {\it funkspiel} in WWII; electromechanical cypher
machines in West Berlin. (This topic is covered well elsewhere in the book.)
\subsection{TEMPEST}
The protection of information from remote eavesdropping; air gaps; control
zones; protected distribution systems (PDS)\footnote{Visibility, stories of
poison gas, flammable gas, pressure gauges---reference Anderson (2001).} The
inclusion of acoustic but overlooking of optical, with the exception of
shoulder surfing. Contextual blindness?
\subsection{Optical}
\section{Physical Principles}
Photons, energy, generation atmospheric absorption. Recent development of
high efficiency LEDs (and the unexpected effect that had on reversing LEDs).
Telescopic optics, fibreoptic collection.
\subsection{The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Signal Processing}
\section{Current Research}
Guri {\it et al.} But they are covert channels. But these are covert
channels. Difference between covert channels and side channels
(ref.\ Kocher).
\subsection{Resurgence of Interest 201?--present}
Aside from the `Compromising Reflections' paper, not much happened until
around 2010, except for\ldots\footnote{Parts of this section was presented at
EMC Europe 2018, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (\emph{International Symposium
and Exhibition on Electromagnetic Compatibility}), 27--30 August 2018
\cite{Loughry2018a}.}
\subsection{Perspective}
It's not only LEDs; and LEDs are not only used as status indicators; Figure:
\emph{all} the information channels in and out of a PC---or more accurately,
an information processing system. A new conception of control zone;
Robinson's `energy gap' concept and its applicability to crypto.
\section{Future Directions}
Unpublished research
\subsection{LED Reversing}
\subsubsection{Classical covert channels}
\subsubsection{Dead blow hammer}
