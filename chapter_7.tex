\chapter{Optical TEMPEST}
\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he} leakage of information from a system through a
channel of modulated light is a vulnerability. The operative terms are `leakage',
`information', `channel', and `modulated light'. The \emph{leakage} might be
accidental or it might be caused on purpose by an adversary, but it is not
supposed to be there. \emph{Information} can be anything from a single bit to
large volumes of information; it might be extremely valuable information like
cryptographic keys. \emph{Channels} in the Shannon sense \cite{Shannon1948}
have a bandwidth-delay product, and noise; both of these are important to
understand the risk of optical TEMPEST. And finally, \emph{modulated light}
carries the signal. Light can be modulated in time or in space---here we think of
light modulated in the time domain. Light modulated in the space domain is an
\emph{image}; `shoulder surfing' is a real risk but not the one we are
concerned with here.

Further in the time domain, light can be amplitude-modulated, or frequency, or
phase. Of the three possibilities, amplitude modulation (AM) is the most
plausible, from a physical standpoint, because optical TEMPEST most often
depends on the accidental existence of a modulated---or modulatable---channel,
and AM is the simplest and most straightforward to implement.

If controlled automatically, indicators are not as useful as if they may be set
by the adversary.

Depending on the nature of the leakage, information leakage through optical
emanations may or may not be a covert channel. By the classical definition,
due to \cite{Lampson1973}, a covert channel is made of a pair of communicating
processes, but in many cases, the source of compromising optical emanations
is in hardware, not a programme running on the CPU.

electromagnetic but in the optical spectrum; we consider that to include at
least infrared (wavelengths longer than \SI{700}{\nano\metre}) because of the
ubiquitousness of light emitting diode (LED) sources in that range and their
convenient invisibility to humans.

\section{History}
The U.S.\ National Security Agency (NSA) named TEMPEST, as far as we know. We
don't even know for sure that the word is not an acronym. It is believed to
be a code name, \textsc{Tempest}\footnote{Evidence for it is shaky but there
was supposedly another programme called \textsc{Teapot} dealing with
stimulated RF compromising emanations \cite[p.~539]{Anderson2008a} and
partially corroborated in December of 2013 by Edward Snowden (NSA ANT
catalogue).} but evidence in the open literature is scarce; the only clear
original source is one declassified document dating from 1972 in which
everything related to emanations other than RF is redacted
\cite{NSAtempest2007}.

\subsection{The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Signal Processing}
One surprising thing, to anyone unfamiliar with digital signal processing, is
how effectively it can pull a usable signal out of what appears to be
hopelessly noisy data. An example may be seen in Fig.\ 4 of
\cite{Loughry2002a}.

\section{Future Directions}
Unpublished research
\subsection{LED Reversing}
Recent research---as yet unpublished---extends the idea of information leakage
through LEDs in the other direction. Unintended photosensitivity of junction
semiconductor devices has been known since at least the nineteen-seventies;
UV-eraseable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) chips take advantage of the
fact. Mims \citeyear{Mims1973b} was first to note in print that LEDs work as
photodiodes, both in the forward-biased (photovoltaic) and reverse-biased
(photoconductive) modes.

Would an unmodified LED, with leads splayed out, act as a WiFi powered
optical bug? Could a \SI{5}{\giga\hertz} WiFi illumination power it in
\emph{reverse bias} photoconductive mode to turn it into an optical RF
modulator? It's a nonlinear junction (diode) detector already---but can
incident \emph{optical} radiation modulate through the diode the reflection
from the leads of the ambient microwave interrogation carrier?

Modern microprocessors do not expose their address and data bus lines as
earlier ones did. But what happens when LEDs on external pins (whether
configured for output, by the system designer, or reconfigured for input by an
attacker) drive those pins unexpectedly?

GPIO in 2011 (Google Trends) although the concept dates to Intel 8255 and MOS
6522. The Atmega8 used by Arduino introduced programmable pull-up and pull-down
resistors in 1996 \cite{Mims1973b,Atmel2013,Stringfellow1997}.

External hardware pull-up or pull-down resistors, as on the Intel 8255 and MOS
6522 chips used in the 1980s, were of course inaccessible to an adversary; CMOS
variants of the 8255 had internal pull-up resistors but they were not
programmable. (Automatically configured pull-up or pull-down resistors may be
considered a special case of external discrete hardware components.)

  \caption{Programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors can be abused by
    setting them in non-sensical ways, such as this, to reverse-bias an LED

Programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors, introduced in 1996 with the
ATmega8 microcontroller \cite{Atmel2013} are far more useful to an adversary
adversary because they can be set in nonsensical ways (Figure
\ref{figure:nonsensical}).\footnote{The trick only works if the designer chose
to save a power pin by connecting an LED to a pair of GPIO pins, which might
make sense if unused GPIO pins happen to be available.}
